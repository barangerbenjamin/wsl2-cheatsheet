Hello and welcome to this WSL2 Cheatsheet.
The goal is to gather here all tips and known issues about WSL2!

# Issues

## Input/Output error

This happens when the hidden `wslhost.exe` is not working. We just need to restart it!

Close all WSL2 tabs.

Open a Powershell tab and run the following command:
```bash
wsl.exe --shutdown
```
Check that your Ubuntu is properly stopped with the command
```bash
wsl -l -v
```

Open a new WSL2 Tab, problem should be fixed.


# Tips

## Testing on Rails

Testing wont work by default on wsl2. It requires ChromeDriver and Chrome binary installed. For this we will need the root session (you can skip the next step if you )

Close all WSL2 tabs.
Open a Powershell tab and run the following command:
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu -u root
```

You are now login in your Ubuntu as `root`.

Type the following command to change it's password:
```bash
passwd
```

You will be prompted twice for a new password.

Close this WSL2 tab.

Open a WSL2 tab, you should be logged in with **your** account. Run the following command (1 by 1):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y unzip xvfb libxi6 libgconf-2-4
```

We need to act as the `root` session for the next command, so let's login as root:
```bash
su -
```
Now, let's run:
```bash
sudo curl -sS -o - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | apt-key add
sudo echo "deb [arch=amd64]  http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
```
Press `Ctrl+D` to quit the root session.

If you are unsure about which session you're logged in with, you can use the ```whoami``` command üí°.

Let's run the following commands to install Google Chrome binary and ChromeDriver on your WSL2:
```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install google-chrome-stable
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.41/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown your-session-here:your-session-here /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Replace **your-session-here** by the result of the command ```whoami```. For me the result is ```barangerbenjamin:barangerbenjamin```. ‚ö†Ô∏è

You can now use testing in Rails. You need to open a second tab and run:
```bash
chromedriver
```
In the other tab you can run your tests with:
```bash
rails test:system
```
